**How to connect the mikes to the cameras:**

The mic should contain an aux to aux cable (make sure there is an aux to aux cable in the mic box when checking it out from MSTI)
There's clip on the mic which should slide into the metal clip on the camera (SLIDE is important)
The aux cable should connect the mic and there should be an aux port on the camera under an opening on the right

**At the end of the filming, someone would need to transfer the filmed content over to the MDN drive.** 
There are 2 ways you could do this (which is easier for you):

Harsh's method:
personal usb cord to connect the camera to ipad -> download to personal ipad -> upload onto mdn drive 

Laptop with sd card slot method:
from the SD card -> their laptop (make sure device has a sd card slot) 
-> upload onto mdn drive
