Marketing for Events:

**Introduction**
## Why has the MRP framework been created?

- One of the main challenges this semester has been around planning and prioritisation. A critical factor in our team's growth has been the speed with which ideas move from concept to execution.
- However, this rapid pace places significant demands on marketing to efficiently gather information, plan, and prioritise projects in ways that align with strategic goals. Marketing's hard work and adaptability in managing this have been impressive, but this approach is not sustainable long-term.
- **Going forward, we aim to establish better Marketing frameworks for the team such as MRP that will support prioritisation and streamline information-gathering, enabling more effective campaign planning across departments. This Notion page is specifically designed for team members directly involved with the event, providing them with a clear outline of the information required to market the event accurately and effectively.**

**Goal:**
The purpose of this framework is to improve collaboration across departments, allowing all teams to operate more efficiently and with fewer bottlenecks, making it easier for marketing to move from concept to action without being overwhelmed by competing priorities.

## Notifying Marketing of event

Providing advance notice of an upcoming event alone is insufficient for effective planning. To ensure our team can adequately support the initiative, all relevant information must be submitted to the Marketing  or  the  Business Lead **at least three weeks in advance** of the event.

**That's why...**
**This checklist ensures that marketing has the essential details needed to begin planning and promoting the event effectively.**

Feel free to copy this onto any meeting notes/discord chat as a checklist to track for your convenience - this can be submitted to the @Marketing  or  the Business Lead **at least three weeks in advance** of the event via discord:
